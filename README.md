# JSON:Presenter

A JavaScript engine for running JSON-formatted presentation scripts.

This project was born out of a desire to create PowerPoint-like presentations that can run from a static website. I have devised a JSON format (subject to change at this point) to define the structure, content and progress of a presentation. The JavaScript engine runs any such script to create the presentation.

Features included will not necessarily match those of PowerPoint. One of the aims of this project is to include animation features such as marquees or text that appears to be typed live. This would allow the creation of storyboards that propose a given look and feel, without the need to build an actual product prototype. Such presentations would not require any programming, just the ability to manage JSON.

The JSON:Presenter project is in a very early stage of development. Comments and enquiries are welcome.
