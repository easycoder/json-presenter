# JSON::Presenter

A JavaScript engine for running JSON-formatted presentation scripts.

This project started with a desire to create presentations that could run from a static website. I devised a JSON format (subject to change at this point) to define the structure, content and progress of a presentation, and wrote a JavaScript engine that runs any such script to create the presentation.

This is not a PowerPoint emulation. Among my aims are to include animation features such as marquees or text that appears to be typed live, and embedded program code to allow interctivity during the presentation. This would allow the creation of storyboards that propose a given look and feel, without the need to build an actual product prototype. Such presentations would not require any programming (except for added program code), just the ability to manage JSON.

The JSON::Presenter project is in an early stage of development. Comments and enquiries are welcome.

For an overview of the project see [this article on dev.to](https://dev.to/gtanyware/json-presenter-a-scripting-language-for-web-based-presentations-1okf).

This README will be extended to become a reference manual for JSON::Presenter.
